1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user:

No, I don't think that a unit test would be an appropriate to test a messaging feature of an application. Unit tests are intended to test 1 singular thing, and a messaging feature has many different things constantly changing about it and likely involes many moving parts together.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters:

Yes, I would because this is one feature that can be tested alone. It doesn't require anything else to be ran/tested and is simple to understand.
